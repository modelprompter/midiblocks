# About

**Midiblocks is a visual, all-in-one MIDI mapping, scripting, and live coding platform for driving highly collaborative MIDI experiences.**

Some things Midiblocks can (eventually) help you do:
- Quickly map MIDI to JavaScript variables, functions, and events on any web site or web service
- Use MIDI to drive custom apps with libraries like [magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/), [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [handsfree.js](https://github.com/midiblocks/handsfree), and others
- Send MIDI to your native [Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation#List_of_notable_commercial_DAWs) and apps
- Work on mobile with no internet required
- Work on projects collaboratively

# Setup
## Prereqs
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- This is an older project made [NodeJS LTS (eg 12.x.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - Try using nvm to downgrade if you have Node > 16: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
  - Then: `nvm install 12` and `nvm use 12`
  - If you get node-sass issues, you'll also need Python2: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/
  - You may also need to enable legacy openssl for webpack with: `$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"` (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70582072/npm-run-fails-with-err-ossl-evp-unsupported)

## Installing
- Open terminal and clone this repository with: `git clone https://github.com/midiblocks/midiblocks`
- Change into directory with: `cd midiblocks`
- Run `npm install` from the project root to install dependencies (> 250Mb)
  - If on Windows you'll need to have Python2: https://stackoverflow.com/a/72644081
- Run `npm start` from the project's root to start the app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Browser Support
This project works in all browsers that natively support the [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/). Currently, the following browsers have built-in support:

- Chrome (macOS, GNU/Linux, Android & Windows)
- Opera (macOS, GNU/Linux, Windows)
- Android WebView component (KitKat and above)
- Edge (Windows)

For more info, including on how to support Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari see the [WebMidi docs](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi#browser-support)

> Starting with version 77, [Chrome deprecates Web MIDI usage on insecure origins](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5138066234671104). This means that, going forward, the page will need to be hosted on a secure origin (e.g. https://, localhost: or file:///) and the user will need to authorize usage (no matter if sysex is used or not). [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting), [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com/), Github, and others provide free hosting.
